Implementation of a Mircosoft Paint-like program done for an object oriented
programming class.

The class specified that we should use Java to implement the program, and JavaFX
was the highly-recommended graphics toolkit. 

I took the course as an independent study to avoid going into credit overload.
The people who took the normal class had weekly deadlines to hit. I turned in
code as I completed it.
