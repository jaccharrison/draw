# draw
Implementation of a Mircosoft Paint-like program done for an object oriented
programming class.

The class specified that we should use Java to implement the program, and JavaFX
was the highly-recommended graphics toolkit. 

I took the course as an independent study to avoid going into credit overload.
The people who took the normal class had weekly deadlines to hit. I turned in
code as I completed it.

## Full-Featured Branch

This branch implements a dockable layer manager and tool manager that expand the capabilities of the simple editor in the
deliverables branch. Once I get these frameworks down solid, they will replace the simple framework in the deliverables branch.
