# Draw: Paint clone for OO design course
## 'Deliverables' Branch
"Take the course as an independent study because you can't fit it into your current class schedule without having a credit overload", they said.

"It'll be fun", they said.

I let the CS professor talk me into taking CS 250, object oriented design, as an independent study during the fall of 2017. I was supposed to be building a JavaFX application that implemented some of the functionality of paint. We used an iterative design process, learned how to organize larger source files, etc. etc. etc. For most CS students, this represents their first brush with any significant project, and a big part of the goal of the class was to show them how to tackle a project bit by bit.

I got all that, but in a somewhat compressed time frame - I wrote 4/6 of the 'sprints', or intermediate assignments, during Thanksgiving break because I simply didn't have sufficient waking hours to get all of my other homework done *and* do any significant work on the independent study.

When I got back from break, the professor looked at what I had written, was impressed, and said he was satisfied with my work in the course. He said he thought I had learned the bigger themes that dealt with managing large projects and using a 'spiral' design process, and that I didn't have to finish the actual project if I had better things to do (like prepare for finals). So, this project is actually somewhat unfinished - I might come back to it some day if I'm really bored and don't want to work on any of my other projects.
