## 'Deliverables' Branch
This is a simple JavaFX program that I'm making for an independent study in an object-oriented programming course. Trouble is,
I've been so swamped with my other 17 credit hours that this has largely taken a back burner, especially since its an
independent study and doesn't really have a due-date. It'll have to be done by the end of the semester though, and will have
to meet a certain number of criteria!

That's why, from this point forward until I get the frameworks for layer managers and tool managers setup, this branch will be
for the 'deliverable' version of the program - the one that shows my professor I'm checking off the boxes. It won't be as
impressive; I'll use it to prototype features, get them working, and hopefully integrate them into the more full-featured
'layers' branch.
